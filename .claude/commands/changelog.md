Write and display a changelog entry for the recent changes WITHOUT committing.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Write SHORT TO MEDIUM changelog entries (2-5 bullet points MAXIMUM)
- Do NOT mention stage, phase, or part numbers
- Do NOT include detailed coverage statistics or test counts
- Keep descriptions concise and high-level

**Steps:**
1. Analyze the recent changes in the codebase
2. Determine appropriate semantic version bump (but don't apply it yet)
3. Write a keepachangelog format entry:
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Use categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed
   - Keep bullet points brief and focused

Display the proposed changelog entry for review. Do NOT update files or commit.
