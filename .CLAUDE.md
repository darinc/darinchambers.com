# Project Memory

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript CLI tool using Bun as the runtime...

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use functional programming patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- All functions must have JSDoc comments

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 90% code coverage
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Mock external dependencies

## Architecture Decisions

- We use a pipeline-based command system
- All commands implement the ICommand interface
- Error handling follows the Result<T, E> pattern

## General Rules

- Never use `any` type in TypeScript
- All async functions must handle errors explicitly
- Dependencies should only be added after discussion
