## North Star Statement

Create a terminal-inspired personal website that showcases expertise in AI and software engineering through an immersive, interactive experience that serves as both portfolio and technical demonstration.

## Vision

A hybrid-interface web terminal (vanilla TypeScript) that functions as portfolio, blog, and professional showcase—where visitors experience my technical capabilities through a retro-aesthetic command-line interface enriched with interactive demos, Easter eggs, and playful commands. The site demonstrates 30 years of innovation and expertise in an accessible, memorable format.

## Core Principles

1. Medium = Message: The terminal interface itself demonstrates technical sophistication and attention to craft
2. Whimsy Meets Professionalism: Balance credibility with personality through hidden gems and playful interactions
3. Progressive Disclosure: Hybrid UI allows quick navigation while rewarding exploration for curious visitors
4. AI-Forward: Showcase AI/ML expertise through examples, demos, and interactive elements
5. Premium Craft: Visual polish, performance, and content quality that reflects excellence in engineering

## Success Metrics

- Visitors understand my unique value proposition within 30 seconds
- Technical professionals can quickly find portfolio highlights and contact information
- Memorable enough that visitors return and share with others
- Demonstrates breadth and depth of technical expertise

## Tagline

"Technologist, Inventor | Building What's Next on Rock-Solid Foundations" — reflecting both innovation (AI, cutting-edge work) and reliability (30 years experience, robust foundations).
