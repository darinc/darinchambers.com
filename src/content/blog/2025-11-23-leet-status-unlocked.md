I have a problem. I have an absurd number of unit tests. **1,333**, to be precise.

But this is an 'off by 4 error'. The opportunity to reach 'leet' tester status is just 4 unit tests away

## The Ask

Time to task Claude Code to write exactly 4 more unit tests. No less, no more. (It would have been epic if the number of the counting shall be three... but I can only ask the universe for so much nerd convergence.)

I gave Claude Code a very specific mission: add exactly 4 unit tests. No more, no less.

## Achievement Unlocked

**1,337 passing tests.**

Leet status: achieved.

## Why This Matters

Is this absurd? Absolutely.

Is it unnecessary? Completely.

In my [love letter to developers](/blog/2025-11-14-a-love-letter-to-developers-and-the-terminal), I talked about how AI gives us a safety net that enables pure creative speed. This is the flip side: it also enables pure creative _joy_.

I can ask for exactly 4 tests, and get exactly 4 tests. I can pursue absurd goals just for the craft of it. I can celebrate hitting 1,337 because it makes me happy.

_P.S. Yes, I know 1,337 tests for a portfolio site is wonderfully absurd. But if you're going to be absurd, you might as well be precise about it._
