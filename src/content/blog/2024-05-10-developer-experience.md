Great developer experience (DX) isn't about making developers happy—though that's a nice side effect. It's about removing friction that slows down delivery and introduces bugs.

## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Fast Feedback Loops

- Quick build times
- Rapid test execution
- Instant deployment to dev environments

### 2. Clear Documentation

- Code that explains itself
- Up-to-date API docs
- Runnable examples

### 3. Powerful Tooling

- IDE integration
- CLI tools for common tasks
- Automation of repetitive work

### 4. Local Development Parity

- Development environment matches production
- Easy onboarding for new team members
- Minimal setup friction

When developers can focus on solving problems instead of fighting tools, everyone wins—including customers.
