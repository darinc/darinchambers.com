There's a meme that's been bouncing around the internet for years:

> "If you ever code something that feels like a hack but it works, just remember that a CPU is literally a rock that we tricked into thinking."

And then the follow-up:

> "Not to oversimplify: first you have to flatten the rock and put lightning inside it."

## The Miracle We Take for Granted

After 30+ years in this field, I still can't get over this fundamental absurdity.

We take sand—silicon dioxide, literally beach sand—purify it, flatten it into wafers, etch microscopic patterns onto it with light, dope it with impurities, and then run electricity through it in very specific patterns.

And somehow, _somehow_, this creates machines that can:

- Store our memories
- Simulate entire universes
- Connect billions of people across the planet
- Generate art, music, and now even conversations
- Help us land robots on other planets

## The Stack of Miracles

Every time you write code, you're standing on top of the most ridiculous tower of abstractions:

1. **Physics** - electrons moving through silicon
2. **Transistors** - switches made from semiconductor magic
3. **Logic gates** - AND, OR, NOT built from transistors
4. **CPU instructions** - arithmetic and memory operations
5. **Assembly** - human-readable machine code
6. **Operating systems** - managing the chaos
7. **High-level languages** - JavaScript, Python, TypeScript
8. **Frameworks** - abstractions on abstractions
9. **Your code** - solving actual human problems

And at the very bottom? Rocks with lightning in them.

## Why This Still Matters

In our day-to-day work, we deal with bugs, deadlines, technical debt, production incidents. We get frustrated when things don't work. We take for granted that pressing keys on a keyboard somehow makes pixels appear on a screen.

But sometimes it's worth stepping back and appreciating the sheer _impossibility_ of what we do.

Every line of code you write is participating in one of humanity's greatest achievements: teaching rocks to think.

## The Wonder Never Fades

I've written millions of lines of code across dozens of languages and platforms. I've built distributed systems, AI models, developer tools, enterprise architectures.

And I'm still amazed that any of it works at all.

When you trace your code all the way down—through the frameworks, through the languages, through the operating system, through the instruction set, through the logic gates, through the transistors—you end up at something that shouldn't be able to think but somehow does.

## Keep the Sense of Wonder

The next time you're debugging a gnarly issue at 2 AM, or refactoring legacy code, or wrestling with a complex algorithm, remember:

You're not just pushing electrons around.

You're teaching rocks to think.

And that's pretty damn magical.

_P.S. Yes, modern CPUs are made from highly purified silicon with intricate manufacturing processes involving photolithography, chemical vapor deposition, ion implantation, and other incredibly sophisticated techniques. But at the end of the day? We flattened some rocks and put lightning in them. And they think._
