## IPO Growth Journey

I built and led the Infrastructure and Data Infrastructure teams through a period of explosive hypergrowth: 400→4,000+ employees and **30→350+ engineers**. We took the company from a $191M valuation through an IPO to a $3B+ public entity. To support this, I helped architect a production Kubernetes platform from scratch, ensuring infrastructure was an enabler, not a bottleneck.

## Culture at Scale

Hypergrowth often kills culture. To prevent this, I launched **ACV Tech Talks**: a biweekly learning program by engineers, for engineers. Over three years, **75 different engineers gave 128+ talks** on topics ranging from Vim to Machine Learning. I personally presented 12 talks (including K8s autoscaling and blameless postmortems) and served as a pivotal sponsor for our 24-hour internal hackathons. These initiatives ensured we remained a learning organization even at scale.

## Cost Optimization & Migration

When COVID-19 impacted the auto industry, swift fiscal action was required. I led the infrastructure team to **reduce our multi-cloud spend by 40%** through aggressive resource optimization and autoscaling logic. Simultaneously, we internalized a massive migration of an acquired company's on-prem stack to the cloud. Originally scoped for an outsourced firm at >$1M, my team completed the migration with **half the headcount and one-third of the budget**, moving the entire stack to AWS with zero downtime.

## Infrastructure Platform

We didn't just run servers; we built a product for our developers. I oversaw the creation of a comprehensive K8s platform featuring Jenkins CI/CD automation, infrastructure-as-code, and scale-ready monitoring. This multi-tenant system allowed 350+ engineers to ship continuously, effectively decoupling deployment speed from infrastructure complexity.
