## Virtual Lift: Portable Undercarriage Imaging

I invented and proved feasibility of a portable vehicle undercarriage imaging system in one week. The innovation combined custom hardware (ultra-low profile mirror assembly with integrated lighting) with sophisticated software (real-time video processing, automated image stitching, ML-powered defect detection). Protected by **US Patent 10893213B2**, the system captures full bumper-to-bumper undercarriage images in under 60 seconds without requiring expensive hydraulic lifts.

## Impact

Scaled from working prototype to **thousands of units deployed nationwide**, capturing **1.6 million+ images** used daily by **800+ inspectors**. The industry-first capability (launched 2019) eliminated infrastructure barriers and enabled a digital-first wholesale marketplace business model for a company that went public on NASDAQ. The solution proved that combining hardware invention with software innovation can create competitive moats that unlock entirely new business models.
