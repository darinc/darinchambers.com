## IPO Growth Journey

Built and led Infrastructure Team and Data Infrastructure Team through explosive growth: 400→4,000+ employees, **30→350+ engineers**, company went from $191M valuation to IPO to $3B+ public company. Built production Kubernetes platform from scratch that enabled teams to deploy without infrastructure as bottleneck. Interviewed dozens of candidates during hypergrowth, selected 6 of 8 Engineering Managers hired.

## Culture at Scale

Created and ran twice-yearly 3-day/24-hour internal Hackathons. Launched ACV Tech Talks: biweekly learning program by engineers, for engineers. In 3 years, **75 different engineers gave 128+ talks** on everything from vim to machine learning. I personally presented 12 talks including K8s autoscaling, ML, REST APIs, and blameless postmortems. Led teams through COVID with weekly 1:1s adapted for remote work, received "amazingly positive feedback" from direct reports and peers.

## Cost Optimization & Migration

During COVID response, led **40% cloud cost reduction** through resource optimization and autoscaling improvements. Simultaneously took on acquisition migration project: original plan was outsourced consulting company with $1M+ budget and 6-person team. **Completed successfully with half the people and one-third the budget**—moved entire technology stack to AWS with zero downtime, delivered on time under budget constraints.

## Infrastructure Platform

Built comprehensive K8s platform with CICD automation on Jenkins, deployment pipelines with automated testing, infrastructure as code, and monitoring/alerting at scale. Designed for multi-tenant use across entire engineering organization, enabling 350+ engineers to ship continuously without infrastructure team as bottleneck.
