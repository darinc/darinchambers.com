## TrafficLand Broadcast Product

As second employee at a startup with 30 video sources and 3 servers, I pitched an idea to leadership: create a custom broadcast application for CNN's The Situation Room to display live traffic video on air. Built the application with optimized video streaming, GOP caching to reduce switching lag, and zero-downtime deployments. The CNN integration succeeded, and I turned this one-off into a new business line serving TV stations nationwide. **Became 30% of company revenue within one year**. The systems I built are **still powering traffic cameras on TV and online today**, 15+ years later.

## Image Engine (US Patent 7739332)

Invented Image Engine™, a distributed caching system for efficiently serving images from thousands of traffic cameras on low-bandwidth connections. The multi-tier caching architecture with intelligent fetch strategies and graceful degradation **saved hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly in circuit costs**. Protected by **US Patent 7739332** for the distributed caching approach.

## Scale

Architected platform growth over 8 years: **30→20,000+ video sources** nationwide, **3→150+ servers** across multiple data centers, maintained **99.99% reliability** at scale. Built custom transcoder platform, single-command deployment system, and video quality monitoring with automatic issue detection.
