# TODO

Remaining tasks for the settings system and site enhancements.

---

## Testing & Quality

- [x] Test coverage improvements (Phase 1: Terminal, EnvVarManager, contact - 70.33% → 74.53%)

- [ ] Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Mobile/tablet responsive testing

## Accessibility ⚠️

- [ ] **Reduced motion support** - Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` (documented in AUDIT.md)
- [ ] High contrast mode - Add theme or `prefers-contrast` media query
- [ ] Enhanced screen reader support - Complete ARIA implementation, test with screen readers

## UX Polish

- [ ] Loading states/transitions for settings changes - Visual feedback

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Additional preset themes (dracula, solarized, monokai)
